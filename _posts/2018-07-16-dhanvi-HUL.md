# SUMMERS AT HUL

Before I start with the review proper, just a small disclaimer. The following is my honest opinion, and hence represents the same. If you are looking to apply, I highly suggest asking others who have also been a part of the program, for they may have completely different opinions and takeaways. I have split the review into 4 sections, each covering a broad aspect of the internship experience overall. Ready? Let’s go

# HUL as an Employer

Hindustan Unilever, as most of you probably would know, is one of the top Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs) companies globally. It has been around for quite a lot of time, and is quite deep rooted our homes, through their many brands. A few of them just off the top of my head would be Lifebuoy, Pears, Close Up, Knorr, Kwality Walls, Lakme, Bru etc.

HUL is a fantastic place to work. This mainly stems from the fact that the work culture is great, where innovation is nurtured, and good work appreciated. The support you will get as an intern is unprecedented, with people from all over the world helping you achieve what will probably be a very ambitious set of objectives. When it comes to getting work done, there is little hierarchy, where you will find yourself presenting your findings and plans to the most senior executives (we’re talking people who handle the whole of South Asia), and they will always make time for you and contribute to your progress. Overall, it is a company that respects it’s employees, and the work life reflects that

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, and the HUL office reflects that: Swimming pool, gym, and even a jam room with a lot of instruments (being musically inclined, this was a gold mine :P). There are no assigned desks, so you can work anywhere in the campus, or even from home, with a lax-ish WFH policy. There were also multiple parties, which were super fun. 

# Selection Procedure

Now that I’ve done a good job selling the company to you, let’s see how one can get in. So HUL is among a handful of companies that comes on Day 1 of internships, and is highly sought after. It offers a boat load of cash, and a great experience. They open mainly for two profiles: RnD and Supply Chain. In simple terms, RnD looks after product specification development, how it should technically perform, and the process for making it. Supply Chain is implementing this on a super large scale, taking into consideration time and resource constraints. Both profiles have their fair share of challenges, and are very different but equally interesting profiles. On a personal note, if you are a Mechanical engineer, RnD is a Pandora’s Box, because most RnD is on chemical formulations and process, so be warned, and keep that in mind. 

The next step is a Group Discussion, which is to see how you perform in a group. This is especially tricky, considering it’s a form of evaluation new to most people. If you do well in the GD, you get shortlisted for Personal Interviews. There are two of these, both of which are highly technical and will test core knowledge, along with ambition and your world view. I suggest a good amount of prep if you want to stand a decent chance, due to the competition 

# Internship Experience

As a mechanical engineer in the RnD division at HUL, I was already a bit apprehensive about what sort of work I’d get. You must be wondering why this article is in the WnCC Intern Blog, considering it is a core chemical-mechanical company working on making soaps. The answer is simple: DATA IS THE NEW OIL. This is an expression that I have heard extensively, and for good reason. Every company, small or big, old or new, is looking to digitise operations and become sleeker for the digital age. I was part of managing this transition (in a small way) at my internship

My project, to be put succinctly, was to digitise the research operations for soap bars. This involved designing a Data Acquisition system, putting the hardware in place to collect this data reliably, and then a Data Modelling system which would build the required model, to predict the properties of the soap bar at each stage of the process just from the formulation details and the process/utility parameters. For this, I had to build and train a neural net which would do this. Since my model depended on my data, which in turn depends on my system, the work was circular and iterative, involving me to make changes to one based on the requirements / constraints of the other. In the end, I came up with a proof of principle for the entire end-to-end system, and that was that.

During the normal course of work, I would interact with process analytics experts in the UK, along with Data Systems Firms with my proposals. This gives you a lot of exposure, and a reality check. You think you’ve understood a problem, but when an expert starts probing you, you will realise the depths of the issue. Since this is not in it’s core workstream, you will not really have to code any of these solutions on your own. You just need to make a small scale version (which I used an online service for), and figure out some third party to scale. So if you’re looking for cutting edge coding work, you’ve barked up the wrong tree. But this internship will give you a flavour of project management, and taking ownership for one’s work and driving it to completion

# TL;DR / Conclusion (You know who you are)

To summarize, HUL is a great employer, respects it’s interns with a structured program with well quantified deliverables, and a significant quantum of work. The work itself can be quite fun, and really depends on you. Usually, you get adequate support from your team to try out new things, and really take ownership of your project. There are times when you’ll have to manage people and their resources, but these are all great learning experiences. I would not apply here looking for work if you are interested in CS, but take this as an example that Data Science and CS in general is everywhere (the last place would be a soap company really). It is up to you to find those opportunities. 

# Thank you for spending the time to read this, and I wish you the very best of luck :D
